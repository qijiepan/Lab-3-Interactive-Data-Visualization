interactive data
#A list of interactions your simulation currently supports, and why they support (or don’t support) user understanding. 
Random distribution of initial states will occur with mouse clicking. User could see what the difference will be by the right plot. 
It is pretty convenient for user to know the changes and the process by different initial status. 
#Three (or more) interaction opportunities you identified from your analysis, this lab, and the handout. Tell me: 
–	Describe what the user needs to be able to see/do. 
–	How you identified these problems. 
–	What interaction technique(s) can fill them. 

1.	Detail:  The user will want to find the detailed information in certain time. (To see the number of each element in simulation by mouse movement)
Because right plot only show the curve diagram and when the curve become closer, it is pretty hard for user to distinguish them. And it’s also pretty hard for user to know the exact information in that time.
So the techniques of showing detail when moving to some positions will be helpful, more easy for user to understand what’s is going on now.
2.	Different chart: from the left simulation and right curve diagram, user may not know the relationship between each element. It will be much user-friendly if the user can change the diagram from curve diagram to pie chart, and it will be easy to find the relation between the elements from a different view.
So we could use a list button to show different chart – pie chart, curve diagram and so forth.
3.	Data interaction: User may want to input their initial value to test what the change will be in the future. (To simulate the different situation). For example, to test what if there is only prey in simulation, or there is no disease in the simulation. There will be much more helpful to simulation lots of times to modify the rules or to better simulate the real life.
We could design the input field to satisfy the user’s requirement to implement different input value.

# interactive method

You can see the exact species number when you move your mouse to the historgram. 
For example, you can see the prey's number the only thing you need to do is to move the mouse to the prey's bar.That's it!
It will be much more eaiser for users to know the number of every species in different time.
